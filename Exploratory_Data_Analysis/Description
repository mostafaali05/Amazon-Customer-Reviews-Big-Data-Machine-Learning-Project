# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Databricks

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted using Databricks for the Amazon Reviews dataset. The primary focus is on the 'Apparel' category.

## Rationale for Using Databricks

Given the substantial size of the dataset, traditional methods using EC2 instances were insufficient due to memory constraints. Databricks offers a scalable platform that can efficiently handle large datasets, making it an ideal choice for this analysis.

## Data Access Setup

### Amazon S3 Bucket Configuration

- The dataset is stored in an S3 bucket named `amazon-reviews-ma`.
- Modified the bucket's access policy to 'public read-only' to simplify data access from Databricks.
- This change ensures seamless integration and data retrieval during the analysis process.

### Databricks Environment Setup

- Registered for a Databricks community account.
- Created a 'MA cluster' within Databricks to run the analysis.

## Dataset

- **File Chosen for EDA**: `amazon_reviews_us_Apparel_v1_00.tsv`
- **Size**: 1.8 GB
- This file contains reviews from the 'Apparel' category and is used for the initial phase of EDA.

## Analysis Overview

The EDA conducted in this project aims to uncover insights from the 'Apparel' category of Amazon reviews. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand customer sentiments, review trends, and other relevant patterns in the data.
